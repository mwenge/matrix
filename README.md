This is the disassembled and [commented source code] for the 1982 Commodore 64 port of Gridrunner by Jeff Minter. 

A version of the game you can play in your browser can be found at [https://gridrunner.xyz].

## Requirements

* [64tass][64tass], tested with v1.54, r1900
* [VICE][vice]

[64tass]: http://tass64.sourceforge.net/
[vice]: http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/
[https://gridrunner.xyz]: https://mwenge.github.io/gridrunner.xyz
[commented source code]:https://github.com/mwenge/gridrunner/blob/master/src/gridrunner.asm
To compile and run it do:

```sh
$ make
```
The compiled game is written to the `bin` folder. 

To just compile the game and get a binary (`gridrunner.prg`) do:

```sh
$ make gridrunner
```


# Disassembling the Game

## Introduction
A quick glance at the [disassembled source] will tell you that I haven't untangled everything in there yet. Maybe I will get bored and stop chipping away at it, however the bones of the disasssembled code are well defined and it is possible to follow the high-level game flow. So before I lose interest in it and move onto the next thing I'm writing up the disassembly process while it is still fresh in my mind.

[disassembled source]:https://github.com/mwenge/gridrunner/blob/master/src/gridrunner.asm

I came here because I tried to disassemble one of Minter's other games, Iridis Alpha, with no knowledge of 6502 assembly or the Commodore 64 architecture, and quickly realized I need to try something smaller (and presumably less complex) first.

Two previous disassembly efforts of two different C64 games greatly assisted me in understanding how C64 binaries work. Ricardo Quesada's disassembly of [Commando], from which I adapted the Makefile and build process, was extremely informative. A disassembly of [Attack of the Mutant Camels] by 'C64 Mark' was extremely helpful in understanding what to look for in a Minter game.

Other than that, outright step-by-step documentation of how to disassemble a C64 game is thin on ground. This while there is an enormous literature on 6502 assembly, C64 internals, and other miscellanea. So the purpose of this write-up is to give someone a the HOWTO that either didn't exist or I failed to find.

## History of Gridrunner
The game circulates in many forms since it's original release on the VIC 20 in 1982. This disassembled version is derived from the version made available by Jeff Minter in `Llamasoft1.d64`. Presumably Minter ported it himself, and presumably it was a largely copy and paste job. Obviously, the disassembled code will only superficially resemble the 'real' source code, if such a thing still exists. This is 'obvious', because the disassembly will include lots of artefacts to do with loading the game and moving memory around to cope with the fact that is going to be loaded from a cartridge (as we will see later). In the main though, it does seem to be possible to reverse engineer the code enough to get a sense of the coding style. The game was coded by a 20 year old Minter in a single week: "the best week of work I've ever done" according to [this interview with Beta].

Gridrunner went on to become something of a Llamasoft franchise. Minter reimagined the game on multiple platforms including the ATari ST, the Amiga, Windows (Gridrunner++ and Gridrunner Revolution). So given its distinguished subsequent history it seems worthwhile to dig up the source of the C64/VIC20 version and see what it looks like. Of course, if I was doing this again I would disassemble the actual VIC20 version rather than the C64 port, but that would have required knowledge and forethought.

## Starting the Disassembly
A guiding principle in the disassembly effort is to ensure the disaseembled and commented source we create can be complied to a byte-for-byte copy of the original `gridrunner.prg` binary in the `orig` folder. So when we compile it we always ensure that the md5sums of the compiled binary and the original match. Doing this greatly simplifies the disassembly process, ensuring any false steps in the disassembly process are found quickly!

```sh
robert@mwenge-desktop gridrunner (master)]$ make gridrunner.prg 
64tass -Wall --cbm-prg -o bin/gridrunner.prg -L bin/list-co1.txt -l bin/labels.txt src/gridrunner.asm

```

The first step is to extract the game's binary from `Llamasoft1.d64`. (I now can't seem to find where I sourced this file!)
[Llamasoft1.d64]:https://github.com/mwenge/gridrunner/blob/master/orig/Llamasoft1.d64

We do this using a tool called c1451 distributed with the popular Commodore 74 emulator Vice.

```sh
c1451 Llamasoft1.prg
dir
read gridrunner gridrunner.prg
```
There is a wealth of 6502 disassembly tools out there, many of them geared for C64 binaries and most of them available only on Windows. The two I ended up using were [Regenerator] and [Infiltrator].

When you skip straight to loading the `gridrunner.prg` file into [Regenerator], as I did, you are confronted with lots of lines like:

```asm

$082D: 6C 00 80            JMP (p8000)              
```
As I later learned, this is what a reasonably successful disassembly looks like. Garbage on the other hand looks something like this:

```asm

```

The clue here is the frequent occurence of '.BYTE' sequences in the disassembly on the right-hand column: the disassembler can't come up with plausible sequences of assembly op-codes. Once I realized that '20' was hex for 'space' and that the 5X values are ASCII values, it seemed likely that this section contained some sort of text data. I later disassembled it, and the garbage that comes after it, to the following:

```asm
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 Cartridge File System (?)                                                           
 This must be something to do with the cartridge rom.                                
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
       .TEXT "        PRG   ", $00

       BRK #$1F                                                                      
                                                                                    
```

As the comment says, I later guessed that this section must have something to do with the cartridge the game was distributed on. Poking around the [C64 wiki] I found that Cartridge ROM lives at `$8000`, so a previous section in the disassembled code started to make sense:

```asm
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
; Copies the game code from $0900 to $8000 and starts executing code                    
; at $8000. This is the address of the cartridge ROM and is where the code will         
; be executed when the game is loaded from a cartridge.

It's reasonable to ask what I mean by 'at `$8000`'. The remarkable thing about the C64 is its simplicity. When programs run they have access to the 64K (65,532 bytes) of memory. This entire memory map 'lives' in the address space `$0000` to `$FFFF`. So `$0001` is the second byte in the memory bank (`$0000` is the first), while `$0010` is the 17th byte in the memory bank. Each address stores a single byte. Throughout the disassembly process and while attempting to rewrite the `gridrunner.prg` binary we are going to get very used to thinking of everything in hexadecimal so you just have to imagine that at each of the 65,532 locations a single byte can stored and retrieved. 

The first two bytes in `gridrunner.prg` give the address it should be loaded at. You can see this when you load the file in a hex editor:

```sh
00000000: 0108 0b08 0a00 9e32 3036 3100 0000 a000  .......2061.....
00000010: a909 85fd a980 85ff 84fc 84fe b1fc 91fe  ................
00000020: c8d0 f9e6 fde6 ffa9 a0c5 ffd0 ef78 6c00  .............xl.
00000030: 8020 2020 2020 2020 2050 5247 2020 2000  .        PRG   .
00000040: 5f08 0f00 2020 2243 2d36 3420 4241 434b  _...  "C-64 BACK
00000050: 5550 2e42 414e 4b22 2050 5247 2020 2000  UP.BANK" PRG   .
00000060: 7f08 0900 2020 2022 4c4f 5041 4745 2024  ....   "LOPAGE $
00000070: 3420 2434 3822 2020 2020 5052 4720 2000  4 $48"    PRG  .
```

That `0108` is the little-endian (lo-hi, wrong-way round) expression for `$0801`. Telling the C64 to load all the data that follows in the prg from `$0801` onwards in its memory map.

The ASCII rendering of the first few bytes gives us a clue that some of it is 'text'. The '2061' is another clue. It turns out that in order to execute the program first few instructions are a BASIC instruction: '10 SYS 2061'. 2061 is decimal for `$080D`. So what this instruction means is: execute the code at address `$080D`.

```asm

I was now at the point where I needed to get a basic handle on what the different assembly instructions mean. This [6502 tutorial] and this reference at [6502 opcodes] were perfectly adequate for getting the hang of things. 

At this point I started to try unpicking some routines in the program, with not very rapid results. 

One potential avenue in to the game, is to look for the game's main loop. This should be a sequence of JSR (Jump to Subroutine) instructions. Basically a series of functions called over and over again. Sure enough, scrolling through the raw disassembly you find this:

```asm
$0CA3: 20 F8 84            JSR e84F8  
$0CA6: 20 9B 85            JSR e859B  
$0CA9: 20 35 86            JSR e8635  
$0CAC: 20 D7 86            JSR e86D7  
$0CAF: 20 53 87            JSR e8753  
$0CB2: 20 9A 88            JSR e889A  
$0CB5: 20 C9 88            JSR e88C9  
$0CB8: 20 A0 89            JSR e89A0

My current reading of this is:

```

The loop is much longer and jumps around a bit in the code before circling back to 'Main_GameLoop', but you get the idea and can see how this would be a useful method of picking your outwards into the rest of the program.

## Identifying the Game's Data

What I would have done next though, had I known how to do it, is identify the game's character set data. For a game like Gridrunner, which doesn't have any sprites, this character set data unlocks a lot of the games mechanics once you have extracted it and know what to look for elsewhere in the program. For example, once you know that the Gridrunner itself (i.e. the player's ship) is stored at index $07 in the character set you can look for lines in the disassembly where it is referenced and see if this is where the ship is being moved.

The way to go about identifying where the character set data is in the disassembly is to look for lines that set the address at `$D018` to point to the place where the character set has been loaded. If a program has a custom character set, `$D018` must contain the address where that set was loaded to memory. In the case of Gridrunner we see that the address where the character set was loaded is `$2000`:

```asm
 Init_Chars                                                       
 $D018 must be set to point to the address of the custom character
 set that we loaded to $2000. So do that.                         
       LDA #$D0                                                   
       STA zpHi2                                                  
       LDA #$00                                                   
       STA zpLo2                                                  
       LDY #$18                                                   
       TYA                                                        
       STA (zpLo2),Y                                              
       LDY #$20   ; $2000!                                                
       LDA #$00                                                   
       STA (zpLo2),Y                                              
       INY                                                        
       STA (zpLo2),Y                                              
```

Searching the raw disassembly we find where it was loaded to `$2000` from:

```asm
1BEC: A2 00               LDX #$00      
1BEE: BD 00 8E    b1BEE   LDA f8E00,X   
1BF1: 9D 00 20            STA f2000,X   
1BF4: BD 00 8F            LDA f8F00,X   
1BF7: 9D 00 21            STA f2100,X   
1BFA: CA                  DEX           
1BFB: D0 F1               BNE b1BEE     
1BFD: 4C 00 81            JMP e8100     
```

So `$8E00` and `$8F00`. Now, given that the program was copied from `$0900` to `$8000` when the game was loaded we have to apply an offset to find the appropriate spot in the raw disassmbly of `gridrunner.prg`. This offset in the raw disassembly is `$1700`:

```asm
$16FF: 20 18 18            JSR s1818

```

The jumble of opcodes and bytes tell us that this is probably the place. What we want to do now is extract this data as a series of byte statements, one line for each character in the character set, like so:

```asm
.BYTE $18,$18,$18,$18,$FF,$18,$18,$18 ; CHARACTER 0           
.BYTE $F0,$20,$10,$1F,$1F,$10,$20,$F0 ; CHARACTER 1           
.BYTE $18,$18,$18,$18,$BD,$C3,$81,$81 ; CHARACTER 2           
.BYTE $00,$20,$60,$A3,$2C,$30,$00,$00 ; CHARACTER 3           
.BYTE $00,$02,$05,$C8,$30,$00,$00,$00 ; CHARACTER 4           
.BYTE $08,$04,$3E,$20,$10,$10,$08,$08 ; CHARACTER 5           
```
You can achieve this in [Regenerator]. (While working this out what I actually did was use [Infiltrator] to export the range of bytes to a raw binary file. I then used [CBM Prg Studio] to import the file and view the character sets. This started to give me an idea of what each character was.)

Once I had a list of byte statements I read up on how the character set values are constructed in [C64 CharSet]. They are simply bitmaps. Each byte is taken as a string of 1s and 0s, where a 1 represents a pixel. So for example we can visualize 'Character 0' above as:

```asm
.BYTE $18,$18,$18,$18,$FF,$18,$18,$18 ; CHARACTER 0            
                                        ; $00                  
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 11111111   ********  
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 00011000      **     
                                        ; 00011000      **     
```

And here's the iconic Gridrunner ship:

```asm
.BYTE $18,$3C,$66,$18,$7E,$FF,$E7,$C3 ; CHARACTER 7           
                                        ; $07                 
                                        ; 00011000      **    
                                        ; 00111100     ****   
                                        ; 01100110    **  **  
                                        ; 00011000      **    
                                        ; 01111110    ******  
                                        ; 11111111   ******** 
                                        ; 11100111   ***  *** 
                                        ; 11000011   **    ** 
```
I used a simple [Python script] to create this commented version of each character.

## Identifying other Data

With the character sets identified, it became much easier to pick through the disassembly and identify other game data.

For example, the text on the title menu:

```asm
;CopyrightLine                                            
        .BYTE $3C,$3D,$20,$31,$39,$38,$32,$20 ; (c) 1982  
        .BYTE $2B,$27,$2F,$20,$20,$2E,$22,$27 ; HES  PRE  
        .BYTE $2F,$2F,$20,$2A,$24,$22,$27,$20 ; SS FIRE   
        .BYTE $3A,$30,$20,$29,$27,$21,$24,$26 ; TO BEGIN  
ByJeffMinter                                                                                 
       .BYTE $29,$1B,$20,$2C,$27,$2A,$2A,$20,$2D,$24,$26,$3A,$27,$22,$20 ; "BY JEFF MINTER " 
       NOP                                                                                   
EnterLevelText                                                                               
       .BYTE $27,$26,$3A,$27,$22,$20,$3E,$27,$3B,$27,$3E,$20,$30,$30,$20 ; "ENTER LEVEL 00 " 
```
You can see that each of the byte values corresponds to the character's index in the character set. So this isn't ASCII text being used to display the title screen text, it's character set bytes.

Now I could start to identify sections of the code relating to recognizable sequences in the game play, such as the interstitial displayed between levels:
