survivors of the Gridrunner squadrons, are sitting watching TV when
suddenly an announcement breaks in:
   "All pilots with Gridrunner experience report to bare immediately.
This is an emergency!"
Arriving at base, you are shown into a briefing room. already thronged
with pilots. The briefing begins:
   "We have brought you here because once again earth it in danger.
The droids have returned - with superior weapons and tactics! We intend
to form a new squadron - Codename MATRIX - of the best pilots to combat
this menace!
   You will be flying the latest fighters - capable of operation on or
off the power matrix and with improved firepower and manoeuverability.
   However, the droids have better weapons, to.... Scouts have
reported droids dropping bombs and flying at crazy angles, and areas
out in space with forcefields which are liable to hurl your fire
straight back at you!
   We also believe the droids are attempting some kind of bizarre
psychological disorientation tactics - some pilots have reported
sighting what appeared to be camels running down the matrix....
   We can only advice you to be prepared for anything to happen. You
will be assigned twenty sectors each - Please do your best to clear
all sectors!
   The earth depends on your success!.......
So now you find yourself seated in your fighter as the Power Matrix
slips gently by below you, every nerve taut as you wait to unleash
a stream of white-hot death on the enemy....

      during these waves. Blast Cameloids fast to keep score level
      or increasing.
   b) IN NORMAL WAVES - Cameloids mix with droids, confusing player
      and causing droids to descend faster.

   different paths. Watch out for ricochets, and learn how the
   deflexors change.

   their attack in diagonal tracking phase.
